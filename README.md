# timetrk

## About timetrk
_timetrk_ is a time tracking tool for projects, utilizing the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) as a way to support our ability to stay concentrated and work efficiently. It is kept fully offline, so private data does not leave the local machine.

It is continously being improved and more features are added to make it a well-functioning open source tool for efficient project work and easy time tracking.

## List of planned features
- Notification on finished intervals
- Simple time tracking of projects without the Pomodoro intervals
- Statistics on past tracking data
- Exporting tracking data to csv
